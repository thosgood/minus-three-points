  \p{
    I conjecture that the set of motives with integer coefficients of the form #{T(X)} for some #{1}-motive #{X} is stable under extensions.
    If #{T'} is a motive with integer coefficients, with #{T'\otimes\QQ\simto T(X)\otimes\QQ}, then #{T'} is of the form #{T(X')} with #{X'} isogenous to #{X}.
    The conjecture is thus equivalent to the claim that the set of motives #{T(X)\otimes\QQ}, for #{1}-motives #{X}, is stable under extensions.
    The word "conjecture" is an abuse of terminology, since the statement itself is not precise.
    What is conjectured is that every realisation system \ref{minus-three-points-1.9} (or \ref{minus-three-points-1.24}, over #{S}) that is an extension #{T(X)} by #{T(Y)} (for #{1}-motives #{X} and #{Y}), and "natural", "coming from geometry", is isomorphic to that defined by a #{1}-motive #{Z} that is an extension of #{X} by #{Y}.

    ##{
      A(\QQ) \simto \Ext^1(\ZZ(0),T(A))
