For an abelian variety $A$ over $\QQ$, we denote by $T(A)\otimes\QQ$ the motive $\HH_1^\mot(A)$ that is dual to $\HH_\mot^1(A)$, and by $T(A)$ the motive with integer coefficients defined by the integer structure $\HH_1(A(\CC),\ZZ)\subset\HH_1(A(\CC),\QQ)=(T(A)\otimes\QQ)_\BB$.
\oldpage{106}The functor $A\mapsto T(A)$ is fully faithful: from $T(A)$ we can recover $\Lie(A)=T(A)_\DR/F^0$ and the complex torus
$$
  A(\CC)
  = T(A)_\BB\setminus\Lie(A)
  = T(A)_\BB\setminus T(A)_\DR\otimes\CC/F^0.
$$
The complex torus $A(\CC)$ determines the abelian variety $A_\CC$ over $\CC$ induced by $A$, and the $\QQ$-structure is uniquely determined by that of the Lie algebra.

An abelian scheme $A$ over $S$ similarly defines a smooth motive with integer coefficients $T(A)$ over $S$.

Recall that a \em{smooth $1$-motive} $X$ over a scheme $S$ consists of

a. a group scheme $L$ over $S$ that, locally, for the étale topology, is a constant group scheme defined by a free $\ZZ$-module of finite type;
  an abelian scheme $A$ over $S$, and a torus $T$ over $S$;
b. an extension $E$ of $A$ by $T$, and a morphism $\bar{u}\colon L\to A$;
c. a morphism $u\colon L\to E$ lifting $\bar{u}$.

We write $X=[L\xrightarrow{u}E]$.

A $1$-motive $X$ over $\QQ$ defines a motive over $\QQ$ with integer coefficients $T(X)$ (cf. [[D3](D3), Section 10, but the crystalline aspect is missing]), and the functor $X\mapsto T(X)$ is fully faithful (cf. [[D3](D3), both 10.1.3 and 2.2]).

For $X=[\ZZ\to0]$, $T(X)$ is the unit motive $\ZZ(0)$.
For $X=[0\to\Gm]$, $T(X)$ is the Tate motive $\ZZ(1)$.
For an abelian variety $A$ and $X=[0\to A]$, $T(X)=T(A)$.
Of course, here, as in \ref{minus-three-points-2.2}, we can take more general bases than $\Spec(\QQ)$.

I conjecture that the set of motives with integer coefficients of the form $T(X)$ for some $1$-motive $X$ is stable under extensions.
If $T'$ is a motive with integer coefficients, with $T'\otimes\QQ\simto T(X)\otimes\QQ$, then $T'$ is of the form $T(X')$ with $X'$ isogenous to $X$.
The conjecture is thus equivalent to the claim that the set of motives $T(X)\otimes\QQ$, for $1$-motives $X$, is stable under extensions.
The word "conjecture" is an abuse of terminology, since the statement itself is not precise.
What is conjectured is that every realisation system \ref{minus-three-points-1.9} (or \ref{minus-three-points-1.24}, over $S$) that is an extension $T(X)$ by $T(Y)$ (for $1$-motives $X$ and $Y$), and "natural", "coming from geometry", is isomorphic to that defined by a $1$-motive $Z$ that is an extension of $X$ by $Y$.

\oldpage{107}
A point $a$ of an abelian variety $A$ over $\QQ$ defines a $1$-motive $[\ZZ\xrightarrow{u}A]$ with $u(1)=a$.
The motive $T([\ZZ\xrightarrow{u}A])$ is an extension of $\ZZ(0)$ by $T(A)$, and the conjecture, applied to $\ZZ(0)$ and $T(A)$, implies that
$$
  A(\QQ) \simto \Ext^1(\ZZ(0),T(A))
$$
or, equivalently,
$$
  A(\QQ)\otimes\QQ \simto \Ext^1(\QQ(0),T(A)\otimes\QQ)
$$
(where $\Ext^1$ is in the abelian category of motives).

More generally, if $E$ is an extension of an abelian variety by a torus, we want
$$
  E(\QQ) \simto \Ext^1(\ZZ(0),T(E))
$$
and similarly for more general bases that $\Spec(\QQ)$.

The case $E=\Gm$ is particularly interesting: for every smooth scheme $S$ over $\Spec(\ZZ)$, we want, in the category of motives with integer coefficients over $S$,

$$
  \Gamma(S,\OO_S^\times) \simto \Ext^1(\ZZ(0),\ZZ(1)).

We explicitly describe the torsor in motives $K(x)$ for $\ZZ(1)$ (the \em{Kummer torsor}) corresponding to $x\in\QQ^\times$ as in \ref{minus-three-points-2.4.1}.

The $\ZZ(1)_\BB$-torsor $K(x)_\BB$ is the torsor for $2\pi i\ZZ$ of logarithms of $x$.
Since $F^0\ZZ(1)_\DR=0$, we have $K(x)_\DR=\ZZ(1)_\DR=\QQ$.
The $\ZZ/(n)(1)$-torsor $K(x)_{\ZZ/(n)}$ is the torsor of $n$-th roots of unity of $x$.
The transition morphisms $K(x)/_{\ZZ(nm)}\to K(x)_{\ZZ/(n)}$ are given by $y\mapsto y^m$.
The Galois action is evident.

The morphism $\comp_{\DR,\BB}$ is induced by the inclusion of $K(x)_\BB$ into $\CC$.

\oldpage{110}On $\Gm=\Spec\ZZ[q,q^{-1}]$, the universal section $q$ of $\Gm$ also defines a torsor in motives $K(q)$ for $\ZZ(1)$, on the base $\Gm$.
We now describe it.

The $\ZZ(1)_\BB$-torsor $K(q)_\BB$ on $C^\times$ is the local system of logarithms of $q$.
Since $F^0\ZZ(1)_\DR=0$, $K(q)_\DR$ is trivial: $K(n)_\DR=\OO$ (on ${\Gm}_\QQ$).
It is endowed with the integrable connection $\nabla\colon K(q)_\DR\to\Omega^1\otimes\ZZ(1)_\DR=\Omega^1$ given by
$$
  \nabla u = \dd u - \frac{\dd q}{q}.
$$
The $\ZZ/(n)(1)$-torsor $K(q)_{\ZZ/(n)}$ is that of the $n$-th roots of $q$.
This is a locally constant sheaf on $(\Gm\otimes\ZZ[1/n])_\et$.
Transition and comparison morphisms are defined as in \ref{minus-three-points-2.9}.

We now explain what the $F$-crystal structure is at $p$.
Let $\hGm$ be the completion of $\Gm$ along its fibre of characteristic $p$, and $\hGm\otimes\QQ_p$ the corresponding rigid analytic space.
For a Frobenius lifting $\widetilde{F}\colon\hGm\to\hGm$, the crystalline Frobenius is a morphism $\phi_p[\widetilde{F}]$, over $\hGm\otimes\QQ_p$, from $\widetilde{F}^\bullet K(q)_\DR$ to $K(q)_\DR$ that is horizontal and compatible with the torsor structures.
If we change $\widetilde{F}$ to $\widetilde{F}'$, then $\widetilde{F}$ and $\widetilde{F}'$ have the same reduction modulo $p$, the connection $\nabla$ gives an isomorphism of $\widetilde{F}^\bullet K(q)_\DR$ with $\widetilde{F}'^{\bullet} K(q)_\DR$, and the diagram
$$
  \begin{CD}
    \widetilde{F}^\bullet K(q)_\DR @>{\phi_p[\widetilde{F}]}>> K(q)_\DR
  \\@| @|
  \\\widetilde{F}'^{\bullet} K(q)_\DR @>>{\phi_p[\widetilde{F}']}> K(q)_\DR
  \end{CD}
$$
commutes.

In terms of $\phi_p^{-1}\colon K(q)_\DR\to\widetilde{F}'^{\bullet} K(q)_\DR$, and via the identifications $K(q)_\DR=\ZZ(1)_\DR=\OO$, whence $\widetilde{F}'^{\bullet}=\OO$, the compatibility with the torsor structures and with the connections can be written as
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    \phi_p^{-1}(k+m)
    &= \phi_p^{-1}(k) + pm
  \\\dd\phi_p^{-1}(0)
    &= \widetilde{F}^\bullet\left(\frac{\dd q}{q}\right) - p\frac{\dd q}{q}.
  \end{aligned}
$$
When we change the Frobenius lifting, we have
$$
  \phi_p^{-1}[\widetilde{F}'](0) - \phi_p^{-1}[\widetilde{F}](0)
  = \log(\widetilde{F}'/\widetilde{F}).
$$
For $\widetilde{F}\colon q\mapsto q^p$, we have
$$
  \phi_p^{-1}[q\mapsto q^p](0) = 0.
$$
\oldpage{111}For $x\in\QQ$ a unit at $p$, and $\widetilde{F}$ such that $\widetilde{F}(x)=x$, we thus have $\phi_p^{-1}[\widetilde{F}](0)=\log(x/x^p)$ at $x$, as required by \ref{minus-three-points-2.9}

# Torsors for $\ZZ(n)$ {#section-3}

\oldpage{112}The study of the fundamental group of $\PP^1\setminus\{0,1,\infty\}$ reveals, for each $k\geqslant2$, a torsor $P_{1,k}$ for $\ZZ(k)$ on $\Spec(\ZZ)$.
We will describe these torsors in this section.
The relation with $\pi_1$ will be explained in \fref{minus-three-points-16} (see \fref{minus-three-points-16.23}) and the calculations to justify this will be given in \fref{minus-three-points-19}.
We will then describe the torsors $P_{d,k}$ for $\ZZ(k)$ on $\Spec(\QQ(\sqrt[d]{1}))$, given by an analogous construction \fref{minus-three-points-16.28}.

The sum of the $\P_{d,k}$ and of $(-1)^k$ times its symmetry under $\zeta\mapsto\zeta^{-1}$ is torsion.
This is essentially equivalent to the adelic integral formulas for the value of the Dirichlet $L$ functions at negative integers: \fref{minus-three-points-3.6}, \fref{minus-three-points-3.8}, \fref{minus-three-points-3.9}, and \fref{minus-three-points-3.14}.
A geometric interpretation, which allows us to reprove these formulas, will be given in \fref{minus-three-points-18}.

A geometric interpretation of the relations of distributions \fref{minus-three-points-3.13} will be given in \fref{minus-three-points-17}.

We denote by $P$ the torsor $P_{1,k}$ that we are going to define.
At the same time, we will define a trivialisation $u_\BB\in P_\BB$ of its Betti realisation.
Since $F^0\ZZ(k)_\DR=0$, we necessarily have that $P_\DR=\ZZ(k)_\DR=\QQ$.
The Betti structure is
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    P_\BB
    &= u_\BB + (2\pi i)^k\ZZ \subset \PP_{\DR,\CC} = \CC
    \quad\text{with}
  \\u_\BB

$$
where $\zeta$ is the Riemann $\zeta$ function.

Let $N$ be an integer; we will describe $P_{\ZZ/(N)}$.
For $z\in\CC$ with $z\neq1$, let $T_N(z)\coloneqq K(1-z)_{\ZZ/(N)}$ be the $\ZZ/N(1)$-torsor of $N$-th roots of $1-z$.
For $z=1$, we set $T_N(1)=K(1/N)_{\ZZ/(N)}$.
This convention ensures that the sum of the $T_N(\alpha)$ for $\alpha^N=1$ is trivialised: we have
$$
  \frac{1}{N}\prod(1-\alpha)
  = 1.
$$

Let $\alpha$ be an $N$-th root of $1$.
It defines $\alpha\colon\ZZ/N\to\ZZ/N(1)$ by $a\mapsto a\cdot\alpha$.
We thus obtain $\alpha^{\otimes(k-1)}\colon\ZZ/N(1)\to\ZZ/N(k)$.
Note that, for $\alpha=1$, this is the zero map.
We denote by $\alpha^{\otimes(k-1)}T(\alpha)$ the $\ZZ/N(k)$-torsor induced from $T(\alpha)$ by applying $\alpha^{\otimes(k-1)}$.
We have
$$
  P_{\ZZ/(N)}
  \coloneqq \sum_{\alpha^N=1} \alpha^{\otimes(k-1)}T_N(\alpha).
\startverb\tag{3.1.2k}\stopverb
$$
\oldpage{113}It is equivalent to sum over the $\alpha\neq1$.
This definition still makes sense in any algebraic closure $\overline{k}$ of $\QQ$, and the action of $\Gal(\bar{\QQ}/\QQ)$ is given by transport of structure.

We now define the transition morphisms $P_{\ZZ/(NM)}\to P_{\ZZ/(N)}$.
We have
$$
  \prod_{u^M=z} (1-u)
  = 1-z
\startverb\tag{3.1.3}\stopverb
$$
whence, for $z\neq0,1$, we obtain an isomorphism
$$
  T_N(z)
  = \prod_{u^M=z} T_N(u).
\startverb\tag{3.1.4}\stopverb
$$
If $\beta^N=1$ and $\alpha^M=\beta$, then the reduction $\mod N$ of $\alpha\colon\ZZ/NM\to\ZZ/NM(1)$ is $\beta\colon\ZZ/N\to\ZZ/N(1)$, and that of $T_{NM}(\alpha)$ is $T_N(\alpha)$.
From this, we obtain an isomorphism
$$
  \begin{aligned}
    P_{\ZZ/(NM)}\mod N
    &= \sum_{\beta^N=1} \sum_{\alpha^M=\beta} \alpha^{\otimes(k-1)}T_{NM}(\alpha) \mod N
  \\&= \sum_{\beta^N=1} \beta^{\otimes(k-1)} \sum_{\alpha^M=\beta} T_N(\alpha)
  \\&= \sum_{\beta^N=1} \beta^{\otimes(k-1)} T_N(\beta)
  \\&= P_{\ZZ/(N)}.
  \end{aligned}
$$
This defines the desired transition morphism.

For non-real negative $z$, we define the *principal determination* of $z\mapsto z^{1/N}$, and denote by $z^{1/N}$, that which takes the value of $1$ at $1$.
The morphism of torsors $\comp_{\ZZ/(N),\BB}$ sends $u_\BB$ to the point $u$ of $P_{\ZZ/(N)}$ defined by the $(1-\alpha)^{1/N}\in T(\alpha)$:
$$
  u_\BB
  \mapsto u
  = \sum \alpha^{\otimes(k-1)} ((1-\alpha)^{1/N}).
$$

If $z$ is not real and $\geqslant1$, then we have principal determinations
$$
  \prod_{u^M=z} (1-u)^{1/N}
  = (1-z)^{1/N}
\startverb\tag{3.1.5}\stopverb
$$
as we verify by analytic continuation from $z=0$, taking (3.1.3) into account.
It follows from (3.1.5) that the $\comp_{\ZZ/(N),\BB}$ are compatible with the transition morphisms.

The cohomology class of $P_{\ZZ/(N)}$ (for $N=\ell^n$) in $\HH^1(\Spec(\QQ),\ZZ/(N)(k))$ thus admits the following description.
Let $\QQ(\zeta)$ be the cyclotomic field generated by a primitive $N$-th root of $1$.
In $\HH^1(\Spec(\QQ(\zeta)),\ZZ/N(1))$, let $\delta(1-\zeta)$ be the Kummer coboundary of $1-\zeta$.
On $\Spec(\QQ(\zeta))$, $\zeta$ identifies the $\ZZ/N(a)$ with one another, and we can think of $\delta(1-\zeta)$ as a class with values in $\ZZ/N(k)$.
More precisely, we consider $\zeta^{\otimes(k-1)}\cup\partial(1-\zeta)\in\HH^1(\Spec(\QQ(\zeta)),\ZZ/N(k))$.
We have
$$
  \cl(P_{\ZZ/\ell^n})
  = \frac{1}{1-\ell^{k-1}} \Tr_{\QQ(\zeta)/\QQ}(\zeta^{\otimes(k-1)}\cup\partial(1-\zeta))
$$
and the class of $P_\ell$ is the limit of these classes.

We denote by $\zeta^{(p)}(s)$ the $\zeta$ function with its Eulerian factor at $p$ removed:
$$
  \zeta^{(p)}(s)
  \coloneqq \sum_{p\nmid n} 1/n^s.
$$
We know that the values of $\zeta^{(p)}(s)$ on the negative integers are rational and admit a $p$-adic interpolation.
More precisely,

a. Let $\CC_p$ be the completion of an algebraic closure of $\QQ_p$.
  Then the characters $\chi\colon\ZZ_p^\times\to\CC_p^\times$ are the points of a rigid analytic space.

b. \oldpage{116}There exists exactly one rigid analytic function $\zeta_p^{(p)}(\chi)$, with a simple pole at $\chi=(x\mapsto x^{-1})$, such that
  $$
    \zeta_p^{(p)}(x\mapsto x^{-1})
    = \zeta^{(p)}(n)\in\QQ
  $$
  for every integer $n<0$.

We set, for $n\in\ZZ$ with $n\neq1$,
$$
  \zeta_p^{(p)}(n)
  \coloneqq \zeta_p^{(p)}(x\mapsto x^{-1}).
$$
This notation differs from that of [@C] or [@Ko]: our $\zeta_p^{(p)}$ is not a continuous $p$-adic function of the *integer* $n$.
Instead, it is a continuous function of the *character* $x\mapsto x^n$, itself a continuous function of $n$ if and only if we restrict $n$ to an arithmetic progression of difference $p-1$.
We have
$$
  \zeta_p^{(p)}(n)
  = \lim_a \zeta^{(p)}(n-(p-1)p^a).
$$
The trivial zeros of $\zeta$ force $\zeta_p^{(p)}(n)=0$ for even $n$, i.e. for $x\mapsto x^{-n}$ an even character.
More generally, $\zeta_p^{(p)}(\chi)=0$ for even $\chi$.

With this notation, we have (cf. [@C; @Ko])
$$
  \vp \ell_k^{(p)}(1)
  = \zeta_p^{(p)}(k)
$$
and (3.2.7) can be rewritten as
$$
  \phi_p^{-1}(0)
  = (k-1)! p^k\zeta_p^{(p)}(k).

For $k$ even, the torsor $P_{1,k}$ is torsion, with order equal to the denominator of $\frac{1}{2}\zeta(1-k)$.

Let $P$ be a torsor for a realisation system $M$ with integer coefficients.
The fact that $P$ is $n$-torsion means more than "every realisation is $n$-torsion".
Let $\frac{1}{n}M$ be the realisation system $M\otimes\QQ$, endowed with the integer structure $\frac{1}{n}M_\BB$.
It is isomorphic to $M$, by an isomorphism that sends $M\hookrightarrow\frac{1}{n}M$ by $n\colon M\to M$.
The fact that $P$ is $n$-torsion thus implies that it becomes trivial under $M\to\frac{1}{2}M$.
For $M$ of weight $\leqslant-1$, this implies:

a. \oldpage{117}$P_\BB+\frac{1}{n}M_\BB\cap F^0 P_\DR\otimes\CC\neq\phi$ (the intersection in $P_\BB\otimes\CC\simto P_\DR\otimes\CC$).
  The point of intersection $x$ is then unique, since $M_\BB\cap F^0(M_\DR)\otimes\CC=0$.
b. $x\in F^0 P_{DR}$, i.e. is defined over $\QQ$ for the $\QQ$-structure $\DR$.
c. The image of $x$ under $\comp_{\AAf,B}$ is fixed by Galois.
d. The image of $x$ under $\comp_{\crisp,\DR}$ is fixed by $\phi_p$.

Suppose that $F^0 M_\DR=0$.
Then $P_\DR=M_\DR$, and we can identify $P_\BB$ with a lateral class of $M_\BB\subset M_\DR\otimes\CC$.
Condition (a) then becomes $P_\BB\subset\frac{1}{n}M_\BB$.
We have $x=0$, and (b) is automatic.
We can write (d) as $\phi_p(0)=0$.
Let $p\in P_\BB$.
Denote by $p_M$ its image in $\frac{1}{n}M_\BB$, and set $p^\wedge=\comp_{\hZZ,\BB}(p)\in P_{\hZZ}$ and $(p_M)^\wedge=\comp_{\AAf,\BB}(p_M)\in M_\AAf$.
Condition (c) can then be written as
$$
  \sigma p^\wedge - p^\wedge
  = (\sigma-1)(p_M)^\wedge.
\startverb\tag{3.6.1}\stopverb
$$

Let $M=\ZZ(k)$ with $k\geqslant1$.
Let $\sigma\in\Gal(\bar{\QQ}/\QQ)$ with image $c$ in $\hZZ^\times$, i.e. $\sigma(\zeta)=\zeta^c$ for $\zeta$ a root of unity.
Condition (3.6.1) can then be written as
$$
  \sigma p^\wedge - p^\wedge
  = (c^k-1)(p_M)^\wedge.
\startverb\tag{3.6.2}\stopverb
$$
Modulo $N$, we obtain: let $c$ be an integer coprime to $Nn$, with $\sigma$ inducing $\zeta\mapsto\zeta^c$ on the $(Nn)$-th roots of unity.
Then $(c^k-1)p_M\in M_\BB$, and
$$
  \comp_{\hZZ,\BB}((c^k-1)p_M)
  \equiv \sigma p^\wedge - p^\wedge \mod{N}.
\startverb\tag{3.6.3}\stopverb
$$

In [(3.5)](#chunk-3.5), $k$ is even, and we can take $p=-(k-1)!\zeta(k)$, and (3.6.3) is a Galois formula for $-(c^k-1)(k-1)!\zeta(k)$ modulo $N(2\pi i)^k\ZZ$.
We recover a known formula expressing $\zeta$ on the negative integers as an adelic integral.
